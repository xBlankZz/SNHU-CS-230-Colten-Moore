# Module 8 Journal

  The Gaming Room made a plan to expand their Android game, Draw It or Lose It, to operate seamlessly on other platforms like Linux, Mac, Windows, and mobile platforms. Their main goal is to launch it as a web application capable of supporting any number of players, while ensuring smooth performance across multiple platforms/devices. There was also a priority of keeping development costs manageable while also making sure the game’s security and scalability were up to par.

  During the documentation phase, I organized information systematically to clarify the project’s design constraints and requirements, which provided invaluable insights into component interactions and simplified the later coding phase. For future projects, I would incorporate different techniques such as user stories and prototyping to better visualize user needs, making sure that the final product is both functional as well as user-friendly.
